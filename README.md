This plug in is a 'utility' plug in that uses midside encoding and decoding with a with controle as the main function. 
it also provides controles for panning left and right signals and phase inverson for left and right signals. the plug in also impliments a gain slider controle. this is to provide a further mixing ablility using a single plugin. 

this plug in can be useful when working with stereo audio as it gives you controle over both left and right signals in each elemet of the plug in.

to start this project one must first insure they have all the softwear listed in the prerequisit. once this is done the developer must start by implemienting the main function of this plugin. this beeing the midside converter and the width controle. 

the code used on this project was infulenced by work of others found on the projucer website mainly from the following link       https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_audio_parameter.html?fbclid=IwAR3CXQ7iZvz3yseuiP-b4wAgMIN3AGD9WSMTSb2BxkvFawKKWCc-mHw9WQM 
and through skills learnt through lab work and lectures at univerity. 

all contributions to this project were made by Caitlin-Hope Turner and Dr David J Moore
